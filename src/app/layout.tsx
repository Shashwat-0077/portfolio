    // =======================
    // üìù Notes on View Transition API
    // =======================

    // IMPORTANT: Scrollbar Consistency
    // All pages must have consistent scroll behavior for view transitions to look smooth.
    // If some pages have a scrollbar and others don‚Äôt, the transition will break or look jumpy.
    // To avoid this, make sure either all pages show a scrollbar, or none do.

    // IMPORTANT: Animate All Page Content
    // Every visible component on the page should animate in (e.g., fade in, slide in, etc.).
    // If any element appears instantly without animation, the transition may look abrupt or broken.

    // HACK: Force Scrollbar + Delay Content Rendering
    // A workaround to make transitions smoother:
    // 1. Disable scroll during the transition.
    // 2. Initially don't render anything on the new page.
    // 3. Add a small invisible element at the bottom (e.g., 1px tall) to force the scrollbar to appear.
    // 4. Once the transition finishes:
    //    - Scroll to the top (likely a 1px scroll).
    //    - Animate in the hero section.
    //    - Then render the rest of the content (which is off-screen, so the user won‚Äôt notice).
    //
    // To implement this:
    // - Use a state variable (e.g., `showContent`) to hide extra content initially.
    // - Set `showContent = true` after the transition is done.

    // NOTE : i don't know why the support for view transitions provided by nextjs is not working properly, but this third-party library is working. so, no complaints here.

    // NOTE : not sure though if this will work with another view-transitions HTML element, haven't tested it yet.
